# Simple React SPA Template

Includes page transitions with Framer Motion.

Handles Error Routes although you may need to write a redirects config for whichever hosting platform you choose.

Includes tailwind although you could remove it and add styled components, or material UI, whatever you like.

Not very comprehensive, I just want a place to save my tsconfig, eslint, and et cetera.

If you would like to use this simply

`git clone https://github.com/0xcire/react_spa.git your_project` \
 `cd your_project` \
 `npm install` \
 `npm run dev`
